### Welcome to bitcoinj

The bitcoinj library is a Java implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, which allows it to maintain a wallet and send/receive transactions without needing a local copy of Bitcoin Core. It comes with full documentation and some example apps showing how to use it.

### Technologies

* Java 7 for the core modules, Java 8 for everything else
* [Gradle 3.4+](https://gradle.org/) - for building the project
* [Google Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf) - for use with serialization and hardware communications

### Getting started

To get started, it is best to have the latest JDK and Gradle installed. The HEAD of the `master` branch contains the latest development code and various production releases are provided on feature branches.

#### Building from the command line

To perform a full build use
```
gradle clean build
```
You can also run
```
gradle javadoc
```
to generate the JavaDocs.

The outputs are under the `build` directory.

#### Building from an IDE

Alternatively, just import the project using your IDE. [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) has Gradle integration built-in and has a free Community Edition. Simply use `File | New | Project from Existing Sources` and locate the `build.gradle` in the root of the cloned project source tree.

### Example applications

These are found in the `examples` module.

### Where next?

Now you are ready to [follow the tutorial](https://bitcoinj.github.io/getting-started).

### Testing a SNAPSHOT build

Building apps with official releases of **bitcoinj** is covered in the [tutorial](https://bitcoinj.github.io/getting-started).

If you want to develop or test your app with a [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io)-powered build of the latest `master` or `release-0.15` branch of **bitcoinj** follow the dynamically-generated instructions for that branch by following the correct link.


* [master](https://jitpack.io/#bitcoinj/bitcoinj/master-SNAPSHOT) branch
* [release-0.15](https://jitpack.io/#bitcoinj/bitcoinj/release-0.15-SNAPSHOT) branch
