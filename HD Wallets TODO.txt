- Switch to the tree format agreed on with slush/stick
- Support seeds up to 512 bits in size. Test compatibility with greenaddress, at least for some keys.
- Make Wallet notify key chains when a key has been observed in a transaction.
- Make DeterministicKeyChain auto-extend when a key was observed, to keep a gap limit in place.
- Support for key rotation
- Support for auto upgrade
- Redo internals of DKC to support arbitrary tree structures.
- Add a REFUND key purpose and map to the receive tree (for now).


API changes:
- WalletAppKit: addWalletExtensions has become provideWalletExtensions has to return the extensions as a list rather
  than adding them to the wallet.
- WalletProtobufSerializer: loadWallet now returns a new Wallet object and takes a list of extensions.
- Wallet: addKey() is now a deprecated alias for importKey(). If you are adding a newly created key, stop. Instead use
  either wallet.currentReceiveKey() or wallet.freshReceiveKey() depending on whether you are going to show an address
  to the user in the UI or you know you need a fresh, unused key right at that moment.
- Most ECKey constructors were replaced with static methods.
- DeterministicKey now derives from ECKey
- WalletEventListener.onKeysAdded got a new Wallet parameter
