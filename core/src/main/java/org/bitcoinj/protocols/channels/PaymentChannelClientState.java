/**
 * <p>A payment channel is a method of sending money to someone such that the amount of money you send can be adjusted
 * after the fact, in an efficient manner that does not require broadcasting to the network. This can be used to
 * implement micropayments or other payment schemes in which immediate settlement is not required, but zero trust
 * negotiation is. Note that this class only allows the amount of money sent to be incremented, not decremented.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class implements the core state machine for the client side of the protocol. The server side is implemented
 * by {@link PaymentChannelServerState} and {@link PaymentChannelClientConnection} implements a network protocol
 * suitable for TCP/IP connections which moves this class through each state. We say that the party who is sending funds
 * is the <i>client</i> or <i>initiating party</i>. The party that is receiving the funds is the <i>server</i> or
 * <i>receiving party</i>. Although the underlying Bitcoin protocol is capable of more complex relationships than that,
 * this class implements only the simplest case.</p>
 *
 * <p>A channel has an expiry parameter. If the server halts after the multi-signature contract which locks
 * up the given value is broadcast you could get stuck in a state where you've lost all the money put into the
 * contract. To avoid this, a refund transaction is agreed ahead of time but it may only be used/broadcast after
 * the expiry time. This is specified in terms of block timestamps and once the timestamp of the chain chain approaches
 * the given time (within a few hours), the channel must be closed or else the client will broadcast the refund
 * transaction and take back all the money once the expiry time is reached.</p>
 *
 * <p>To begin, the client calls {@link PaymentChannelClientState#initiate()}, which moves the channel into state
 * INITIATED and creates the initial multi-sig contract and refund transaction. If the wallet has insufficient funds an
 * exception will be thrown at this point. Once this is done, call
 * {@link PaymentChannelClientState#getIncompleteRefundTransaction()} and pass the resultant transaction through to the
 * server. Once you have retrieved the signature, use {@link PaymentChannelClientState#provideRefundSignature(byte[], KeyParameter)}.
 * You must then call {@link PaymentChannelClientState#storeChannelInWallet(Sha256Hash)} to store the refund transaction
 * in the wallet, protecting you against a malicious server attempting to destroy all your coins. At this point, you can
 * provide the server with the multi-sig contract (via {@link PaymentChannelClientState#getMultisigContract()}) safely.
 * </p>
