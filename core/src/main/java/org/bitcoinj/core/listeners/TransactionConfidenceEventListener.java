    /**
     * <p>Called when a transaction changes its confidence level. You can also attach event listeners to
     * the individual transactions, if you don't care about all of them. Usually you would save the wallet to disk after
     * receiving this callback unless you already set up autosaving.</p>
     *
     * <p>You should pay attention to this callback in case a transaction becomes <i>dead</i>, that is, a transaction
     * you believed to be active (send or receive) becomes overridden by the network. This can happen if</p>
     *
     * <ol>
     *     <li>You are sharing keys between wallets and accidentally create/broadcast a double spend.</li>
     *     <li>Somebody is attacking the network and reversing transactions, ie, the user is a victim of fraud.</li>
     *     <li>A bug: for example you create a transaction, broadcast it but fail to commit it. The {@link Wallet}
     *     will then re-use the same outputs when creating the next spend.</li>
     * </ol><p>
     *
     * <p>To find if the transaction is dead, you can use <tt>tx.getConfidence().getConfidenceType() ==
     * TransactionConfidence.ConfidenceType.DEAD</tt>. If it is, you should notify the user
     * in some way so they know the thing they bought may not arrive/the thing they sold should not be dispatched.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that this callback will be invoked for every transaction in the wallet, for every new block that is
     * received (because the depth has changed). <b>If you want to update a UI view from the contents of the wallet
     * it is more efficient to use onWalletChanged instead.</b></p>
