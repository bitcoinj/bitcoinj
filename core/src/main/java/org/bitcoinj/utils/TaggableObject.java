/**
 * <p>An object that can carry around and possibly serialize a map of strings to immutable byte arrays. Tagged objects
 * can have data stored on them that might be useful for an application developer. For example a wallet can store tags,
 * and thus this would be a reasonable place to put any important data items that the bitcoinj API does not allow for:
 * things like exchange rates at the time a transaction was made would currently fall into this category. Of course,
 * it helps interop and other developers if you introduce a real type safe API for a new feature instead of using this
 * so please consider that path, if you find yourself tempted to store tags!</p>
 *
 * <p>Good tag names won't conflict with other people's code, should you one day decide to merge them. Choose tag names
 * like "com.example:keyowner:02b7e6dc316dfaa19c5a599f63d88ffeae398759b857ca56b2f69de3e815381343" instead of
 * "owner" or just "o". Also, it's good practice to create constants for each string you use, to help avoid typos
 * in string parameters causing confusing bugs!</p>
