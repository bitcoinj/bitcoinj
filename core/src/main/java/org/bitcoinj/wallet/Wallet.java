// To do list:
//
// - Take all wallet-relevant data out of Transaction and put it into WalletTransaction. Make Transaction immutable.
// - Only store relevant transaction outputs, don't bother storing the rest of the data. Big RAM saving.
// - Split block chain and tx output tracking into a superclass that doesn't have any key or spending related code.
// - Simplify how transactions are tracked and stored: in particular, have the wallet maintain positioning information
//   for transactions independent of the transactions themselves, so the timeline can be walked without having to
//   process and sort every single transaction.
// - Split data persistence out into a backend class and make the wallet transactional, so we can store a wallet
//   in a database not just in RAM.
// - Make clearing of transactions able to only rewind the wallet a certain distance instead of all blocks.
// - Make it scale:
//     - eliminate all the algorithms with quadratic complexity (or worse)
//     - don't require everything to be held in RAM at once
//     - consider allowing eviction of no longer re-orgable transactions or keys that were used up
//
// Finally, find more ways to break the class up and decompose it. Currently every time we move code out, other code
// fills up the lines saved!

/**
 * <p>A Wallet stores keys and a record of transactions that send and receive value from those keys. Using these,
 * it is able to create new transactions that spend the recorded transactions, and this is the fundamental operation
 * of the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
 *
 * <p>To learn more about this class, read <b><a href="https://bitcoinj.github.io/working-with-the-wallet">
 *     working with the wallet.</a></b></p>
 *
 * <p>To fill up a Wallet with transactions, you need to use it in combination with a {@link BlockChain} and various
 * other objects, see the <a href="https://bitcoinj.github.io/getting-started">Getting started</a> tutorial
 * on the website to learn more about how to set everything up.</p>
 *
 * <p>Wallets can be serialized using protocol buffers. You need to save the wallet whenever it changes, there is an
 * auto-save feature that simplifies this for you although you're still responsible for manually triggering a save when
 * your app is about to quit because the auto-save feature waits a moment before actually committing to disk to avoid IO
 * thrashing when the wallet is changing very fast (eg due to a block chain sync). See
 * {@link Wallet#autosaveToFile(File, long, TimeUnit, WalletFiles.Listener)}
 * for more information about this.</p>
