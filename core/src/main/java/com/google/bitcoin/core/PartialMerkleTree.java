/**
 * <p>A data structure that contains proofs of block inclusion for one or more transactions, in an efficient manner.</p>
 *
 * <p>The encoding works as follows: we traverse the tree in depth-first order, storing a bit for each traversed node,
 * signifying whether the node is the parent of at least one matched leaf txid (or a matched txid itself). In case we
 * are at the leaf level, or this bit is 0, its merkle node hash is stored, and its children are not explored further.
 * Otherwise, no hash is stored, but we recurse into both (or the only) child branch. During decoding, the same
 * depth-first traversal is performed, consuming bits and hashes as they were written during encoding.</p>
 *
 * <p>The serialization is fixed and provides a hard guarantee about the encoded size,
 * <tt>SIZE <= 10 + ceil(32.25*N)</tt> where N represents the number of leaf nodes of the partial tree. N itself
 * is bounded by:</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * N <= total_transactions<br>
 * N <= 1 + matched_transactions*tree_height
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><pre>The serialization format:
 *  - uint32     total_transactions (4 bytes)
 *  - varint     number of hashes   (1-3 bytes)
 *  - uint256[]  hashes in depth-first order (<= 32*N bytes)
 *  - varint     number of bytes of flag bits (1-3 bytes)
 *  - byte[]     flag bits, packed per 8 in a byte, least significant bit first (<= 2*N-1 bits)
 * The size constraints follow from this.</pre></p>
