 * <p>A KeyChain is a class that stores a collection of keys for a {@link org.bitcoinj.core.Wallet}. Key chains
 * are expected to be able to look up keys given a hash (i.e. address) or pubkey bytes, and provide keys on request
 * for a given purpose. They can inform event listeners about new keys being added.</p>
 *
 * <p>However it is important to understand what this interface does <i>not</i> provide. It cannot encrypt or decrypt
 * keys, for instance you need an implementor of {@link EncryptableKeyChain}. It cannot have keys imported into it,
 * that you to use a method of a specific key chain instance, such as {@link BasicKeyChain}. The reason for these
 * restrictions is to support key chains that may be handled by external hardware or software, or which are derived
 * deterministically from a seed (and thus the notion of importing a key is meaningless).</p>
