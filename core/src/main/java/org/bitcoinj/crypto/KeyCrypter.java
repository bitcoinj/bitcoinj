 * <p>A KeyCrypter can be used to encrypt and decrypt a message. The sequence of events to encrypt and then decrypt

 * <p>(1) Ask the user for a password. deriveKey() is then called to create an KeyParameter. This contains the AES
 * key that will be used for encryption.</p>
 * <p>(2) Encrypt the message using encrypt(), providing the message bytes and the KeyParameter from (1). This returns
 * an EncryptedData which contains the encryptedPrivateKey bytes and an initialisation vector.</p>
 * <p>(3) To decrypt an EncryptedData, repeat step (1) to get a KeyParameter, then call decrypt().</p>
 *
 * <p>There can be different algorithms used for encryption/ decryption so the getUnderstoodEncryptionType is used
