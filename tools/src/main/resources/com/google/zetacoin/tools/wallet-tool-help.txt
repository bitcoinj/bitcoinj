WalletTool: print and manipulate wallets

Usage: wallet-tool --flags action-name
       wallet-tool action-name --flags

>>> ACTIONS
  dump                 Loads and prints the given wallet in textual form to stdout.
  raw-dump             Prints the wallet as a raw protobuf with no parsing or sanity checking applied.
  create               Makes a new wallet in the file specified by --wallet.
                       Will complain and require --force if the wallet already exists.
  add-key              Adds a new key to the wallet, either specified or freshly generated.
                       If --date is specified, that's the creation date.
                       If --unixtime is specified, that's the creation time and it overrides --date.
                       If --privkey is specified, use as a hex/base58 encoded private key.
                       Don't specify --pubkey in that case, it will be derived automatically.
                       If --pubkey is specified, use as a hex/base58 encoded non-compressed public key.
  add-addr             Requires --addr to be specified, and adds it as a watching address.
  delete-key           Removes the key specified by --pubkey or --addr from the wallet.
  sync                 Sync the wallet with the latest block chain (download new transactions).
                       If the chain file does not exist this will RESET the wallet.
  reset                Deletes all transactions from the wallet, for if you want to replay the chain.
  send                 Creates and broadcasts a transaction from the given wallet.
                       Requires either --output or --payment-request to be specified.
                       If --output is specified, a transaction is created from the provided output
                       from this wallet and broadcasted, eg:
                         --output=1GthXFQMktFLWdh5EPNGqbq3H6WdG8zsWj:1.245
                       You can repeat --output=address:value multiple times.
                       If the output destination starts with 04 and is 65 or 33 bytes long it will be
                       treated as a public key instead of an address and the send will use
                       <key> CHECKSIG as the script.
                       If --payment-request is specified, a transaction will be created using the provided
                       payment request. A payment request can be a local file, a bitcoin uri, or url to
                       download the payment request, e.g.:
                         --payment-request=/path/to/my.bitcoinpaymentrequest
                         --payment-request=bitcoin:?r=http://merchant.com/pay.php?123
                         --payment-request=http://merchant.com/pay.php?123

                       Other options include:
                          --fee=0.01  sets the tx fee
                          --locktime=1234  sets the lock time to block 1234
                          --locktime=2013/01/01  sets the lock time to 1st Jan 2013
                          --allow-unconfirmed will let you create spends of pending non-change outputs.
                          --no-pki disables pki verification for payment requests.

>>> GENERAL OPTIONS
  --debuglog           Enables logging from the core library.
  --net=XXX            Which network to connect to, defaults to PROD, can also be TEST or REGTEST.
  --mode=FULL/SPV      Whether to do full verification of the chain or just light mode.
  --wallet=<file>      Specifies what wallet file to load and save.
  --chain=<file>       Specifies the name of the file that stores the block chain.
  --force              Overrides any safety checks on the requested action.
  --date               Provide a date in form YYYY/MM/DD to any action that requires one.
  --peers=1.2.3.4      Comma separated IP addresses/domain names for connections instead of peer discovery.
  --offline            If specified when sending, don't try and connect, just write the tx to the wallet.
  --condition=...      Allows you to specify a numeric condition for other commands. The format is
                       one of the following operators = < > <= >= immediately followed by a number.
                       For example --condition=\">5.10\" or --condition=\"<=1\"
  --password=...       For an encrypted wallet, the password is provided here.
  --ignore-mandatory-extensions   If a wallet has unknown required extensions that would otherwise cause
                       load failures, this overrides that.

>>> WAITING
You can wait for the condition specified by the --waitfor flag to become true. Transactions and new
blocks will be processed during this time. When the waited for condition is met, the tx/block hash
will be printed. Waiting occurs after the --action is performed, if any is specified.\n

  --waitfor=EVER       Never quit.
  --waitfor=WALLET_TX  Any transaction that sends coins to or from the wallet.
  --waitfor=BLOCK      A new block that builds on the best chain.
  --waitfor=BALANCE    Waits until the wallets balance meets the --condition.\n";
