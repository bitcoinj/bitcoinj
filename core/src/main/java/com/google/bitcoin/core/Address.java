 * <p>A Bitcoin address looks like 1MsScoe2fTJoq4ZPdQgqyhgWeoNamYPevy and is derived from an elliptic curve public key
 * plus a set of network parameters. Not to be confused with a {@link PeerAddress} or {@link AddressMessage}
 * which are about network (TCP) addresses.</p>
 *
 * <p>A standard address is built by taking the RIPE-MD160 hash of the public key bytes, with a version prefix and a
 * checksum suffix, then encoding it textually as base58. The version prefix is used to both denote the network for
 * which the address is valid (see {@link NetworkParameters}, and also to indicate how the bytes inside the address
 * should be interpreted. Whilst almost all addresses today are hashes of public keys, another (currently unsupported
 * type) can contain a hash of a script instead.</p>
