- Switch to the tree format agreed on with slush/stick.
- Store the account key creation time for an HD hierarchy.
- Support seeds up to 512 bits in size. Test compatibility with greenaddress, at least for some keys.
- Calculate lookahead keys on a background thread.
- Redo internals of DKC to support arbitrary tree structures.
- Add a REFUND key purpose and map to the receive tree (for now).
- Write unit tests for auto key lookahead code from Harold.
- Pre-check the keys for all attached BlockChainListeners and reset the chain download if any of them throw an exception
  then use this to ensure that we can't accidentally run off the end of an HDW heirarchy when downloading the chain.


API changes:
- WalletAppKit: addWalletExtensions has become provideWalletExtensions has to return the extensions as a list rather
  than adding them to the wallet.
- WalletProtobufSerializer: loadWallet now returns a new Wallet object and takes a list of extensions.
- Wallet: addKey() is now a deprecated alias for importKey(). If you are adding a newly created key, stop. Instead use
  either wallet.currentReceiveKey() or wallet.freshReceiveKey() depending on whether you are going to show an address
  to the user in the UI or you know you need a fresh, unused key right at that moment.
- Most ECKey constructors were replaced with static methods.
- DeterministicKey now derives from ECKey
- WalletEventListener.onKeysAdded got a new Wallet parameter
