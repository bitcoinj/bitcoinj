/**
 * <p>A transaction represents the movement of coins from some addresses to some other addresses. It can also represent
 * the minting of new coins. A Transaction object corresponds to the equivalent in the Bitcoin C++ implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Transactions are the fundamental atoms of Bitcoin and have many powerful features. Read
 * <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/wiki/WorkingWithTransactions">"Working with transactions"</a> in the
 * documentation to learn more about how to use this class.</p>
 *
 * <p>All Bitcoin transactions are at risk of being reversed, though the risk is much less than with traditional payment
 * systems. Transactions have <i>confidence levels</i>, which help you decide whether to trust a transaction or not.
 * Whether to trust a transaction is something that needs to be decided on a case by case basis - a rule that makes 
 * sense for selling MP3s might not make sense for selling cars, or accepting payments from a family member. If you
 * are building a wallet, how to present confidence to your users is something to consider carefully.</p>
