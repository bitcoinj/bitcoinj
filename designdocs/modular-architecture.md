# A rough overview of a modular bitcoinj architecture

Note: this diagram somewhat blurs the distinctions between modules/JARs and packages. Some of the "modules" would remain packages in the short-run.
Other packages that are not significant or are not changing are not shown (and are generally expected to remain in the `core` module). The difference between API and implementation dependencies is (for now) omitted.
