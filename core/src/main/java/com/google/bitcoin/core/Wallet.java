// To do list:
//
// This whole class has evolved over a period of years and needs a ground-up rewrite.
//
// - Take all wallet-relevant data out of Transaction and put it into WalletTransaction. Make Transaction immutable.
// - Only store relevant transaction outputs, don't bother storing the rest of the data.
// - Split block chain and tx output tracking into a superclass that doesn't have any key or spending related code.
// - Simplify how transactions are tracked and stored: in particular, have the wallet maintain positioning information
//   for transactions independent of the transactions themselves, so the timeline can be walked without having to
//   process and sort every single transaction.
// - Decompose the class where possible: break logic out into classes that can be customized/replaced by the user.
//     - [Auto]saving to a backing store
//     - Key management
//     - just generally make Wallet smaller and easier to work with
// - Make clearing of transactions able to only rewind the wallet a certain distance instead of all blocks.
// - Make it scale:
//     - eliminate all the algorithms with quadratic complexity (or worse)
//     - don't require everything to be held in RAM at once
//     - consider allowing eviction of no longer re-orgable transactions or keys that were used up

/**
 * <p>A Wallet stores keys and a record of transactions that send and receive value from those keys. Using these,
 * it is able to create new transactions that spend the recorded transactions, and this is the fundamental operation
 * of the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
 *
 * <p>To learn more about this class, read <b><a href="http://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/wiki/WorkingWithTheWallet">
 *     working with the wallet.</a></b></p>
 *
 * <p>To fill up a Wallet with transactions, you need to use it in combination with a {@link BlockChain} and various
 * other objects, see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/wiki/GettingStarted">Getting started</a> tutorial
 * on the website to learn more about how to set everything up.</p>
 *
 * <p>Wallets can be serialized using either Java serialization - this is not compatible across versions of bitcoinj,
 * or protocol buffer serialization. You need to save the wallet whenever it changes, there is an auto-save feature
 * that simplifies this for you although you're still responsible for manually triggering a save when your app is about
 * to quit because the auto-save feature waits a moment before actually committing to disk to avoid IO thrashing when
 * the wallet is changing very fast (eg due to a block chain sync). See
 * {@link Wallet#autosaveToFile(java.io.File, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, com.google.bitcoin.wallet.WalletFiles.Listener)}
 * for more information about this.</p>

    //           double-spend against them appears in the best chain, in which case they move to the dead pool.
    //           If a double-spend appears in the pending state as well, currently we just ignore the second
    //           and wait for the miners to resolve the race.
    // Unspent:  Transactions that appeared in the best chain and have outputs we can spend. Note that we store the
    //           entire transaction in memory even though for spending purposes we only really need the outputs, the
    //           reason being that this simplifies handling of re-orgs. It would be worth fixing this in future.

    //           for history browsing/auditing reasons only and in future will probably be flushed out to some other
    //           kind of cold storage or just removed.
