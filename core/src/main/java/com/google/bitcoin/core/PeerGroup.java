/**
 * <p>Runs a set of connections to the P2P network, brings up connections to replace disconnected nodes and manages
 * the interaction between them all. Most applications will want to use one of these.</p>
 * 
 * <p>PeerGroup tries to maintain a constant number of connections to a set of distinct peers.
 * Each peer runs a network listener in its own thread.  When a connection is lost, a new peer
 * will be tried after a delay as long as the number of connections less than the maximum.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Connections are made to addresses from a provided list.  When that list is exhausted,
 * we start again from the head of the list.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The PeerGroup can broadcast a transaction to the currently connected set of peers.  It can
 * also handle download of the blockchain from peers, restarting the process when peers die.</p>
 *
 * <p>PeerGroup implements the {@link Service} interface. This means before it will do anything,
 * you must call the {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.Service#start()} method (which returns
 * a future) or {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.Service#startAndWait()} method, which will block
 * until peer discovery is completed and some outbound connections have been initiated (it will return
 * before handshaking is done, however). You should call {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.Service#stop()}
 * when finished. Note that not all methods of PeerGroup are safe to call from a UI thread as some may do
 * network IO, but starting and stopping the service should be fine.</p>

            //
            // (2) If we receive a p2pubkey output broadcast across the network, all currently connected nodes will see
            // it and update their filter themselves, but any newly connected nodes will receive the last filter we
            // calculated, which would not include this transaction.
            //
            // For this reason we check if the transaction contained any relevant pay to pubkeys and force a recalc
            // and possibly retransmit if so. The recalculation process will end up including the tx hash into the
