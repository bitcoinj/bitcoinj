/**
 * <p>This class knows how to force an mmap'd ByteBuffer to reliquish its file handles before it becomes garbage collected,
 * by exploiting implementation details of the HotSpot JVM implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is required on Windows because otherwise an attempt to delete a file that is still mmapped will fail. This can
 * happen when a user requests a "restore from seed" function, which involves deleting and recreating the chain file.
 * At some point we should stop using mmap in SPVBlockStore and we can then delete this class.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is a separate class to avoid hitting unknown imports when running on other JVMs.</p>
