/**
 * <p>A Peer discovery mechanism that keeps a database of peers which are announced by other peers and which we've
 * connected to and returns a subset of those.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is important to use a peer db in addition to DNS seeds (via a {@link DnsDiscovery}) as it:<ul>
 *     <li>Spreads load across the network better, instead of having all bitcoinj clients connect to a specific set of
 *     (rotating) peers.</li>
 *     <li>Prevents DNS seeds from (maliciously or accidentally) forcing you to connect to a specific set of nodes which
 *     are conspiring to provide bad data.</li>
 *     <li>Allows for future protocol changes which allow nodes to fully verify the chain without serving the entire
 *     blockchain.</li>
 * </ul></p>
 *
 * <p>The design is based pretty heavily on sipa/Bitcoin Core's addrman/addr.dat:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Addresses are stored in limited-size sets and thrown away randomly with weight given to addresses not seen in
 * some time (ie no peers have announced them in some time and we have not successfully connected to them in some time).
 * Unlike Bitcoin Core's addrman, we do not have separate groups of sets for addresses which are new and addresses which
 * have been connected to in the past.</li>
 * <li>Sets are indexed by three values: first the IP subnet of the peer which announced the given address, second by
 * the address' IP subnet, and third by a random key which randomizes where collisions will happen. The random key and
 * announcing peer subnet is used to select a group of 16 sets. The random key and IP's subnet are then used to select
 * one of these 16 sets, to which the address is added.</li>
 * <li>The random key is important as it prevents determinism and makes it impossible to predict which sets a given
 * source subnet is able to get its addresses placed in. Thus, an attacker which wants to fill the address database with
 * nodes it controls can only probabilistically fill all sets instead of being able to pick specific source IPs which
 * allow it to place entries in all sets.</li>
 * </ul></p>
